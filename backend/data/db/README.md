# Database Storage Directory

This directory contains the JSON files that serve as persistent storage for the application.

## Files

- `users.json` - User accounts and profiles
- `appointments.json` - Medical appointments
- `reviews.json` - Doctor and app reviews
- `prescriptions.json` - Medical prescriptions

These files are automatically created and managed by the application.
Do not modify them directly unless you know what you're doing.

## Backup

It's recommended to periodically back up these files to prevent data loss.
